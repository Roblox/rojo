# Using rbxlx-to-rojo
## Setup
Before you can use rbxlx-to-rojo, you need to have Rojo 0.5.0 Alpha 12 to use the tool.
You also need a rbxlx place file that has a script. If there aren't any scripts in the rbxlx file, rbxlx-to-rojo will return an error.

Download the latest release of rbxlx-to-rojo here: https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rbxlx-to-rojo/releases
## Porting the game
Let's assume we have a rbxlx file named "game", with a script in ServerScriptService.

### Steps to port the game:
1. Double-click on rbxlx-to-rojo on wherever you installed it.
2. Select a place file.
3. Select the path where you want to place it.

If you followed the steps correctly, you should see something that looks like this:
