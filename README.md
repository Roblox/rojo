<hr />

**Rojo** is a flexible multi-tool designed for creating robust Roblox projects.

It's designed for power users who want to use the **best tools available** for building games, libraries, and plugins.

## Features
Rojo lets you:

* Work on scripts from the filesystem, in your favorite editor
* Version your place, library, or plugin using Git or another VCS
* Sync JSON-format models from the filesystem into your game

Later this year, Rojo will be able to:

* Sync `rbxmx` models between the filesystem and Roblox Studio
* Package projects into `rbxmx` files from the command line

## [Documentation Website](https://lpghatguy.github.io/rojo)
You can also view the documentation by browsing the [docs folder of the repository](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/rojo/tree/master/docs), but because it uses a number of Markdown extensions, it may not be very readable.

## Inspiration
There are lots of other tools that sync scripts into Roblox or provide other tools for working with Roblox places.

Here are a few, if you're looking for alternatives or supplements to Rojo:

* [rbxmk by Anaminus](https://github.com/anaminus/rbxmk)
* [Rofresh](https://github.com/osyrisrblx/rofresh) and [RbxRefresh](https://github.com/osyrisrblx/RbxRefresh) by [Osyris](https://github.com/osyrisrblx)
* [Studio Bridge by Vocksel](https://github.com/vocksel/studio-bridge)
* [RbxSync by evaera](https://github.com/evaera/RbxSync)
* [CodeSync](https://github.com/MemoryPenguin/CodeSync) and [rbx-exteditor](https://github.com/MemoryPenguin/rbx-exteditor) by [MemoryPenguin](https://github.com/MemoryPenguin)

If you use a plugin that _isn't_ Rojo for syncing code, open an issue and let me know why! I'd like Rojo to be the end-all tool so that people stop reinventing solutions to this problem.
