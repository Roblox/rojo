<hr />

**Rojo** is a flexible multi-tool designed for creating robust Roblox projects.

It's designed for power users who want to use the **best tools available** for building games, libraries, and plugins.

## Features
Rojo lets you:

* Work on scripts from the filesystem, in your favorite editor
* Version your place, library, or plugin using Git or another VCS
* Sync JSON-format models from the filesystem into your game

Later this year, Rojo will be able to:

* Sync `rbxmx` models between the filesystem and Roblox Studio
* Package projects into `rbxmx` files from the command line

## [Documentation Website](https://lpghatguy.github.io/rojo)
You can also view the documentation by browsing the [docs folder of the repository](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/rojo/tree/master/docs), but because it uses a number of Markdown extensions, it may not be very readable.

## Inspiration
There are lots of other tools that sync scripts into Roblox or provide other tools for working with Roblox places.

Here are a few, if you're looking for alternatives or supplements to Rojo:

* [Studio Bridge by Vocksel](https://github.com/vocksel/studio-bridge)
* [RbxRefresh by Osyris](https://github.com/osyrisrblx/RbxRefresh)
* [RbxSync by evaera](https://github.com/evaera/RbxSync)
* [CodeSync](https://github.com/MemoryPenguin/CodeSync) and [rbx-exteditor](https://github.com/MemoryPenguin/rbx-exteditor) by [MemoryPenguin](https://github.com/MemoryPenguin)
* [rbxmk by Anaminus](https://github.com/anaminus/rbxmk)

I also have a couple tools that Rojo intends to replace:

* [rbxfs](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/rbxfs), which has been deprecated by Rojo
* [rbxpacker](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/rbxpacker), which is still useful

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome!

All pull requests are run against a test suite on Travis CI. That test suite should always pass!
